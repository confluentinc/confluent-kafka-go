       Package kafka provides high-level Apache Kafka producer and consumers
using bindings on-top of the librdkafka C library.
       <h3 id="hdr-High_level_Consumer">
        High-level Consumer
       </h3>
       <p>
        * Decide if you want to read messages and events by calling `.Poll()` or
the deprecated option of using the `.Events()` channel. (If you want to use
`.Events()` channel then set `"go.events.channel.enable": true`).
        <p>
         * Create a Consumer with `kafka.NewConsumer()` providing at
least the `bootstrap.servers` and `group.id` configuration properties.
         <p>
          * Call `.Subscribe()` or (`.SubscribeTopics()` to subscribe to multiple topics)
to join the group with the specified subscription set.
Subscriptions are atomic, calling `.Subscribe*()` again will leave
the group and rejoin with the new set of topics.
          <p>
           * Start reading events and messages from either the `.Events` channel
or by calling `.Poll()`.
           <p>
            * When the group has rebalanced each client member is assigned a
(sub-)set of topic+partitions.
By default the consumer will start fetching messages for its assigned
partitions at this point, but your application may enable rebalance
events to get an insight into what the assigned partitions where
as well as set the initial offsets. To do this you need to pass
`"go.application.rebalance.enable": true` to the `NewConsumer()` call
mentioned above. You will (eventually) see a `kafka.AssignedPartitions` event
with the assigned partition set. You can optionally modify the initial
offsets (they'll default to stored offsets and if there are no previously stored
offsets it will fall back to `"auto.offset.reset"`
which defaults to the `latest` message) and then call `.Assign(partitions)`
to start consuming. If you don't need to modify the initial offsets you will
not need to call `.Assign()`, the client will do so automatically for you if
you dont, unless you are using the channel-based consumer in which case
you MUST call `.Assign()` when receiving the `AssignedPartitions` and
`RevokedPartitions` events.
            <p>
             * As messages are fetched they will be made available on either the
`.Events` channel or by calling `.Poll()`, look for event type `*kafka.Message`.
             <p>
              * Handle messages, events and errors to your liking.
              <p>
               * When you are done consuming call `.Close()` to commit final offsets
and leave the consumer group.
               <h3 id="hdr-Producer">
                Producer
               </h3>
               <p>
                * Create a Producer with `kafka.NewProducer()` providing at least
the `bootstrap.servers` configuration properties.
                <p>
                 * Messages may now be produced either by sending a `*kafka.Message`
on the `.ProduceChannel` or by calling `.Produce()`.
                 <p>
                  * Producing is an asynchronous operation so the client notifies the application
of per-message produce success or failure through something called delivery reports.
Delivery reports are by default emitted on the `.Events()` channel as `*kafka.Message`
and you should check `msg.TopicPartition.Error` for `nil` to find out if the message
was succesfully delivered or not.
It is also possible to direct delivery reports to alternate channels
by providing a non-nil `chan Event` channel to `.Produce()`.
If no delivery reports are wanted they can be completely disabled by
setting configuration property `"go.delivery.reports": false`.
                  <p>
                   * When you are done producing messages you will need to make sure all messages
are indeed delivered to the broker (or failed), remember that this is
an asynchronous client so some of your messages may be lingering in internal
channels or tranmission queues.
To do this you can either keep track of the messages you've produced
and wait for their corresponding delivery reports, or call the convenience
function `.Flush()` that will block until all message deliveries are done
or the provided timeout elapses.
                   <p>
                    * Finally call `.Close()` to decommission the producer.
                    <h3 id="hdr-Transactional_producer_API">
                     Transactional producer API
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                     The transactional producer operates on top of the idempotent producer,
and provides full exactly-once semantics (EOS) for Apache Kafka when used
with the transaction aware consumer (`isolation.level=read_committed`).
                     <p>
                      A producer instance is configured for transactions by setting the
`transactional.id` to an identifier unique for the application. This
id will be used to fence stale transactions from previous instances of
the application, typically following an outage or crash.
                      <p>
                       After creating the transactional producer instance using `NewProducer()`
the transactional state must be initialized by calling
`InitTransactions()`. This is a blocking call that will
acquire a runtime producer id from the transaction coordinator broker
as well as abort any stale transactions and fence any still running producer
instances with the same `transactional.id`.
                       <p>
                        Once transactions are initialized the application may begin a new
transaction by calling `BeginTransaction()`.
A producer instance may only have one single on-going transaction.
                        <p>
                         Any messages produced after the transaction has been started will
belong to the ongoing transaction and will be committed or aborted
atomically.
It is not permitted to produce messages outside a transaction
boundary, e.g., before `BeginTransaction()` or after `CommitTransaction()`,
`AbortTransaction()` or if the current transaction has failed.
                         <p>
                          If consumed messages are used as input to the transaction, the consumer
instance must be configured with `enable.auto.commit` set to `false`.
To commit the consumed offsets along with the transaction pass the
list of consumed partitions and the last offset processed + 1 to
`SendOffsetsToTransaction()` prior to committing the transaction.
This allows an aborted transaction to be restarted using the previously
committed offsets.
                          <p>
                           To commit the produced messages, and any consumed offsets, to the
current transaction, call `CommitTransaction()`.
This call will block until the transaction has been fully committed or
failed (typically due to fencing by a newer producer instance).
                           <p>
                            Alternatively, if processing fails, or an abortable transaction error is
raised, the transaction needs to be aborted by calling
`AbortTransaction()` which marks any produced messages and
offset commits as aborted.
                            <p>
                             After the current transaction has been committed or aborted a new
transaction may be started by calling `BeginTransaction()` again.
                             <p>
                              Retriable errors:
Some error cases allow the attempted operation to be retried, this is
indicated by the error object having the retriable flag set which can
be detected by calling `err.(kafka.Error).IsRetriable()`.
When this flag is set the application may retry the operation immediately
or preferably after a shorter grace period (to avoid busy-looping).
Retriable errors include timeouts, broker transport failures, etc.
                              <p>
                               Abortable errors:
An ongoing transaction may fail permanently due to various errors,
such as transaction coordinator becoming unavailable, write failures to the
Apache Kafka log, under-replicated partitions, etc.
At this point the producer application must abort the current transaction
using `AbortTransaction()` and optionally start a new transaction
by calling `BeginTransaction()`.
Whether an error is abortable or not is detected by calling
`err.(kafka.Error).TxnRequiresAbort()` on the returned error object.
                               <p>
                                Fatal errors:
While the underlying idempotent producer will typically only raise
fatal errors for unrecoverable cluster errors where the idempotency
guarantees can't be maintained, most of these are treated as abortable by
the transactional producer since transactions may be aborted and retried
in their entirety;
The transactional producer on the other hand introduces a set of additional
fatal errors which the application needs to handle by shutting down the
producer and terminate. There is no way for a producer instance to recover
from fatal errors.
Whether an error is fatal or not is detected by calling
`err.(kafka.Error).IsFatal()` on the returned error object or by checking
the global `GetFatalError()`.
                                <p>
                                 Handling of other errors:
For errors that have neither retriable, abortable or the fatal flag set
it is not always obvious how to handle them. While some of these errors
may be indicative of bugs in the application code, such as when
an invalid parameter is passed to a method, other errors might originate
from the broker and be passed thru as-is to the application.
The general recommendation is to treat these errors, that have
neither the retriable or abortable flags set, as fatal.
                                 <p>
                                  Error handling example:
                                  <pre>retry:

   err := producer.CommitTransaction(...)
   if err == nil {
       return nil
   } else if err.(kafka.Error).TxnRequiresAbort() {
       do_abort_transaction_and_reset_inputs()
   } else if err.(kafka.Error).IsRetriable() {
       goto retry
   } else { // treat all other errors as fatal errors
       panic(err)
   }
</pre>

                                  <p>
                                   Apart from emitting messages and delivery reports the client also communicates
with the application through a number of different event types.
An application may choose to handle or ignore these events.

`AssignedPartitions` and `RevokedPartitions` are symmetrical.
Requires `go.application.rebalance.enable`
                                      <p>
                                       * `PartitionEOF` - Consumer has reached the end of a partition.
NOTE: The consumer will keep trying to fetch new messages for the partition.

These errors are normally just informational since the
client will try its best to automatically recover (eventually).

                                           * `OAuthBearerTokenRefresh` - retrieval of a new SASL/OAUTHBEARER token is required.
This event only occurs with sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER.
Be sure to invoke SetOAuthBearerToken() on the Producer/Consumer/AdminClient
instance when a successful token retrieval is completed, otherwise be sure to
invoke SetOAuthBearerTokenFailure() to indicate that retrieval failed (or
if setting the token failed, which could happen if an extension doesn't meet
the required regular expression); invoking SetOAuthBearerTokenFailure() will
schedule a new event for 10 seconds later so another retrieval can be attempted.
                                           <p>
                                            Hint: If your application registers a signal notification
(signal.Notify) makes sure the signals channel is buffered to avoid
possible complications with blocking Poll() calls.

                            Updates are not transactional so they may succeed for a subset
of the provided resources while others fail.
The configuration for a particular resource is updated atomically,
replacing values using the provided ConfigEntrys and reverting
unspecified ConfigEntrys to their default values.

the provided resources with the new configuration given,
reverting all other configuration to their default values.

                               Multiple resources and resource types may be set, but at most one
resource of type ResourceBroker is allowed per call since these
resource requests must be sent to the broker specified in the resource.

If topic is non-nil only information about that topic is returned, else if
allTopics is false only information about locally used topics is returned,
else information about all topics is returned.
GetMetadata is equivalent to listTopics, describeTopics and describeCluster in the Java API.

2) SASL/OAUTHBEARER is supported but is not configured as the client's
authentication mechanism.

The new credentials will overwrite the old ones (which were set when creating
the admin client or by a previous call to SetSaslCredentials). The new
credentials will be used the next time the admin client needs to authenticate
to a broker. This method will not disconnect existing broker connections that
were established with the old credentials.
This method applies only to the SASL PLAIN and SCRAM mechanisms.

use of the events channel risks receiving outdated events and
messages. Minimizing go.events.channel.size reduces the risk
and number of outdated events and messages but does not eliminate
the factor completely. With a channel size of 1 at most one
event or message may be outdated.

starting offset (&gt;= 0), or one of the logical offsets (`kafka.OffsetEnd` etc),

use the committed offset as a start position, with a fallback to
`auto.offset.reset` if there is no committed offset.

This method is only applicable for use with a subscribing consumer when
handling a rebalance event or callback.
Partitions that have been lost may already be owned by other members in the
group and therefore commiting offsets, for example, may fail.

Typical use is to call Assignment() to get the partition list
and then pass it to Position() to get the current consume position for
each of the assigned partitions.
The consume position is the next message to read from the partition.
i.e., the offset of the last message seen by the application + 1.

Instead, this method blocks until
the fetcher state is updated for the given partition with the new offset.
This guarantees that no previously fetched messages for the old offset (or
fetch position) will be passed to the application once this call returns.
It will still take some time after the method returns until messages are
fetched at the new offset.

(through Assign() or implicitly through a self-rebalanced Subscribe()).

a starting offset for each partition.

(through Assign() or implicitly through a self-rebalanced Subscribe()).
To set the starting offset it is preferred to use Assign() in a
kafka.AssignedPartitions handler and provide a starting offset for each
partition.

retrieval/setting failed; it also schedules a new token refresh event for 10
seconds later so the attempt may be retried. It will return nil on
success, otherwise an error if:
1) SASL/OAUTHBEARER is not supported by the underlying librdkafka build;
2) SASL/OAUTHBEARER is supported but is not configured as the client's
authentication mechanism.

The new credentials
will overwrite the old ones (which were set when creating the consumer or by a previous
call to SetSaslCredentials). The new credentials will be used the next time the
consumer needs to authenticate to a broker. This method will not disconnect
existing broker connections that were established with the old credentials.
This method applies only to the SASL PLAIN and SCRAM mechanisms.

Value is the key's binary value, Kafka does not put any restrictions on the format of
of the Value but it should be made relatively compact.
The value may be a byte array, empty, or nil.

go.events.channel.size (int, 1000000) - Events().
go.produce.channel.size (int, 1000000) - ProduceChannel() buffer size (in number of messages)
go.logs.channel.enable (bool, false) - Forward log to Logs() channel.
go.logs.channel (chan kafka.LogEvent, nil) - Forward logs to application-provided channel instead of Logs(). Requires go.logs.channel.enable=true.

delivered and the transaction commit request has been successfully
handled by the transaction coordinator, or until the `ctx` expires,

The application MUST serve the `producer.Events()` channel for delivery
reports in a separate go-routine during this time.

Check whether the returned error object permits retrying
by calling `err.(kafka.Error).IsRetriable()`, or whether an abortable
or fatal error has been raised by calling
`err.(kafka.Error).TxnRequiresAbort()` or `err.(kafka.Error).IsFatal()`
respectively.

If topic is non-nil only information about that topic is returned, else if
allTopics is false only information about locally used topics is returned,
else information about all topics is returned.
GetMetadata is equivalent to listTopics, describeTopics and describeCluster in the Java API.

of the producer with the same `transactional.id` are completed.
If the previous instance failed with a transaction in progress the
previous transaction will be aborted.
This function needs to be called before any other transactional or
produce functions are called when the `transactional.id` is configured.

but not yet finished, this function will await the previous transaction's
completion.

again.
Providing a nil context or a context without a deadline uses
the timeout 2*transaction.timeout.ms.

This is an asynchronous call that enqueues the message on the internal
transmit queue, thus returning immediately.
The delivery report will be sent on the provided deliveryChan if specified,
or on the Producer object's Events() channel if not.
msg.Timestamp requires librdkafka &gt;= 0.9.4 (else returns ErrNotImplemented),
api.version.request=true, and broker &gt;= 0.10.0.0.
msg.Headers requires librdkafka &gt;= 0.11.4 (else returns ErrNotImplemented),

will ignore any sub-sequent acknowledgement for these messages
received from the broker, effectively making it impossible
for the application to know if the messages were successfully

consumer group coordinator for `consumerMetadata`, and marks the offsets
as part part of the current transaction.
These offsets will be considered committed only if the transaction is
committed successfully.

i.e., the last processed message's offset + 1 for each partition.
Either track the offsets manually during processing or use
`consumer.Position()` (on the consumer) to get the current offsets for
the partitions assigned to the consumer.

Check whether the returned error object permits retrying
by calling `err.(kafka.Error).IsRetriable()`, or whether an abortable
or fatal error has been raised by calling
`err.(kafka.Error).TxnRequiresAbort()` or `err.(kafka.Error).IsFatal()`
respectively.

The new credentials
will overwrite the old ones (which were set when creating the producer or by a previous
call to SetSaslCredentials). The new credentials will be used the next time this
producer needs to authenticate to a broker. This method will not disconnect
existing broker connections that were established with the old credentials.
This method applies only to the SASL PLAIN and SCRAM mechanisms.
